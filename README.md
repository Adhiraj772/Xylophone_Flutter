# Xylophone ðŸŽ¹

In this project I have created a Digital Xylophone.By making this project I got to leaarn about performing actions within the widgets tree and establishing relations within the widgets.
I also got to learn about playing sounds.
The resources for this project were provided in the Flutter Development Udemy course by Angela Yu.
